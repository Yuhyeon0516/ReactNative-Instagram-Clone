# ReactNative-Instagram-Clone

I made it by following some features of Instagram.<br/>
Screens i made three screens: Feed list screen, My page screen and Add feed screen.<br/>
You can see all feed list in Feed list screen. And if feed's double click, you can like this feed.<br/>
When you click add button, you can move to Add feed screen.<br/>
Add feed screen include image upload button, text field and save button.<br/>
After uploading image and entering text, click the save button to upload the feed.<br/>
On My page screen, you can only see your feed. And if you click your feed, you can see your feed detail information.<br/>
